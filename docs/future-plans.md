# Future Plans & Ideas

This document outlines potential future features for remarkable-mcp. These are ideas under consideration, not commitments.

> **Track progress:** See open [enhancement issues](https://github.com/SamMorrowDrums/remarkable-mcp/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3Aenhancement) on GitHub.

### Write Support ([#24](https://github.com/SamMorrowDrums/remarkable-mcp/issues/24))

Currently, remarkable-mcp is read-only. Future versions may add:

- **Create documents** — Create new notebooks or upload PDFs
- **Sync from Obsidian** — Push markdown notes to reMarkable as PDFs
- **Template support** — Apply templates when creating notebooks
- **Folder management** — Create, rename, move folders

Write support requires careful consideration of:
- Sync conflicts with reMarkable's own sync
- Data safety and backup
- API stability

### Additional OCR Providers ([#25](https://github.com/SamMorrowDrums/remarkable-mcp/issues/25))

Google Vision works well, but more options would be valuable:

| Provider | Status | Notes |
|----------|--------|-------|
| Google Vision | ✅ Implemented | Excellent handwriting recognition |
| Tesseract | ✅ Implemented | Offline fallback, poor for handwriting |
| **Microsoft Azure** | 🔮 Planned | Competitive handwriting OCR |
| **Mistral** | 🔮 Planned | Open-weight models with vision |
| **Claude Vision** | 🔮 Possible | Direct integration with Claude |
| **Local LLaVA** | 🔮 Possible | Fully offline, privacy-focused |

The goal is **BYOK (Bring Your Own Key)** — let users choose their preferred provider.

### Enhanced Search ([#26](https://github.com/SamMorrowDrums/remarkable-mcp/issues/26))

- **Full-text indexing** — Index all documents for instant search
- **Semantic search** — Find documents by meaning, not just keywords
- **Cross-document search** — Search annotations across your entire library

### Obsidian Integration

Deep integration with Obsidian vaults:

- **Bi-directional sync** — Notes flow between reMarkable and Obsidian
- **Link resolution** — reMarkable documents as Obsidian attachments
- **Daily notes** — Sync reMarkable journals to Obsidian daily notes

### Export Features ([#27](https://github.com/SamMorrowDrums/remarkable-mcp/issues/27))

- **PDF export** — Export notebooks as PDFs
- **Markdown export** — Convert notebooks to markdown
- **Batch export** — Export entire folders

## Community Requests

Have an idea? Open an issue on GitHub with the `enhancement` label.

Popular requests we're tracking:

1. **Handwriting-to-text conversion** — Beyond OCR, actual handwriting recognition
2. **Tag support** — Organize documents with tags
3. **Favorites** — Quick access to frequently-used documents
4. **Version history** — Access previous versions of documents

## Technical Improvements

### Performance ([#28](https://github.com/SamMorrowDrums/remarkable-mcp/issues/28))

- **Parallel resource registration** — Faster startup for large libraries
- **Incremental sync** — Only fetch changed documents
- **Persistent cache** — Cache OCR results across sessions

### Reliability ([#29](https://github.com/SamMorrowDrums/remarkable-mcp/issues/29))

- **Automatic reconnection** — Recover from dropped SSH connections
- **Retry logic** — Handle transient API failures
- **Health checks** — Proactive connection monitoring

### Developer Experience

- **TypeScript types** — Full type definitions for MCP clients
- **Example integrations** — Sample code for common use cases
- **Plugin system** — Extensible architecture for custom features

## Contributing

Interested in implementing any of these features? We welcome contributions!

1. Check existing issues for the feature
2. Open a discussion if it's a major change
3. Fork, implement, and submit a PR

See [Development Guide](development.md) for setup instructions.

## Non-Goals

Some things we're explicitly **not** planning:

- **reMarkable firmware modifications** — We work with the official software
- **Bypassing DRM** — We respect content protection
- **Subscription circumvention** — Cloud API requires Connect subscription
- **Real-time sync** — We're a query tool, not a sync service
